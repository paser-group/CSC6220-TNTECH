## Guidelines
- All exams are open book, one page both side handwritten cheat sheet allowed, Cheat sheets need to be submitted with exam scripts. 
- No questions on source code in exams 
- Project source code must be maintained in Tennessee Tech Gitlab repos 
- If the instructor detects copy-paste in source code or exams then that will result in direct zero for the corresponding project or exam. 
- Projects can be done individually or by in groups. One the group is formed, then create a repo and then add the instructor as a collaborator 
- Final project report should be spell-checked, typo-free, without passive voice. 
- Mismatch between reported output and source code results will be inspected. The instructor will download repos, install libraries, and run the code based on the instruction provided in the mentioned Markdown file. Reported output and source code results will be checked during project update#1, project update#2, and final project submission. For reproducibility teams are allowed to use Docker containers.   
- Every regrade request in due time will be accepted, but all submissions will be re-checked and may result in reduced points. 
- One project report and one project presentation for each group  
- Use the 'Issues' Feature on GitLab to post questions on the course page: https://github.com/paser-group/CSC6220-TNTECH
